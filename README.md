## ðŸ“ŠEnergy consumption prediction project using mlflow:
- This project focuus  on forecasting daily energy consumption using MLflow to track experiments, manage models, and deploy the best-performing model in a reproducible and monitorable way.

### Models Used:
- Linear Regression (Best Performing Model)
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- XGBoost Regressor

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

### Project contents:
- .venv : virtual environment
- 3 images in png of model comparison.
- energy.ipynb: the jupyter notebook with all the code.
- energy_consumption.docs: project report/explanation.
- energy_consumption.ppt: project presentation.
